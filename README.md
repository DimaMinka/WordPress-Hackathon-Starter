## Wordpress Hackathon Starter Theme

This is a starter theme designed for developers and made by the awesome [Advanced WordPress Israeli community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wordpresspro/)

The entire development process is done trough Github with [Discord](https://discord.gg/GkdSv2f) as our communication platform of choice

### Background

There are a lot of modern design tools out there, but we wanted something custom made we as developer could use to bootstrap our WordPress projects in the best way possible.

Moreover, We thought a collaboration of this sort would bond the community together, create a collaborative network of professionals, and teach whoever wants to be thought about our development workflow and methods

### Development Tools
* The development proccess will be done by forking this repository and using pull request.
* Voice and chat communication will be in our dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GkdSv2f)

### Tools of choice
_This is an initial and incomplete list_

* Bootstrap 4
* Gulp / Webpack
* SASS
